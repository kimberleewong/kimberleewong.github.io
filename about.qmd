## Education and Work!

<p class="title">

### UC Santa Barbara
I am currently a student at the UC Santa Barbara Bren School of Environmental Science and Management. I am pursuing my Master's of Environmental Data Science. With the fast paced nature of this program, I have learned so much in such a short time span. I've enjoyed furthering my skills in R, Python, Java, and SQL.

### UC Los Angeles
I was an Environmental Science student in undergrad at UC Los Angeles, and it was during one of my required classes, coding for environmental science, that I found a great appreciation for data science and the value of programs like R.
