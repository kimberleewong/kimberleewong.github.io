Hello! My name is Kimmy Wong! I am a recent graduate from the UCSB Bren School of Environmental Science and Management where I got my Master of Environmental Data Science. Before that, I was at UCLA for my undergraduate degree in Environmental Science. It was at UCLA that I found an appreciation for data visualization and GIS mapping as tools to address pressing environmental challenges. I'm excited to continue enhancing my skills in modeling, data analysis, and data visualization and apply these competencies to tackling the environmental issues I have been passionate about since volunteering as an education interpreter at the Aquarium of the Pacific in high school.
